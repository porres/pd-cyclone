#X text 113 274 MAC/Win users \, hold on as Pd freezes while it takes a good amount of time to open "All_about_cyclone" \, which loads ALL objects from Cyclone. This is a one time thing and the externals will load fast afterwards., f 37;
#X text 58 101 Hey \, you downloaded the 'cylone' library from 'deken' \, nice! This library comes with separate binaries and a sub library. You need to add its path to your search paths and you should also load the 'cyclone' binary as a library \, which will give you some information on the terminal and install a subset of non-alphanumeric objects plus an object browser plugin! You can also do this by creating the [cyclone] external as below., f 58;
#X text 57 445 To use the browser plugin \, right click on an empty space on the patch canvas and check entry menus for 'cyclone' \, which will allow you to choose and add the desired object in the spot you right clicked on. If you hate this idea you can go to Preferences => Cyclone-Browser-plugin and disable it \, then save this setting., f 58;
#X text 57 543 Note: - If you already had an earlier version of Cyclone installed when you downloaded this version \, you have to restart Pure Data for some changes to take effect and objects to recerate! Specially if you had the cyclone binary loaded!!!, f 58;
